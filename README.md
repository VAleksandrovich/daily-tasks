<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Every day we are faced with numerous things that we have to do. And sometimes in the hustle and bustle of the day we forget to do them, since the brain is constantly digesting a large amount of information. The purpose of creating this project is to make life easier and allow users to track their daily tasks just using a simple application named   ***List to Do***.

Here's why you need to try it out:

* Your life will become more productive!
